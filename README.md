# Frog Summon Utils

This is a collection of utilities I find useful in building projects I'm working on. No frogs are harmed in the making of these utilities.

## Publishing

1. Make changes.
2. Update the version in `package.json`.
3. Run `npm run build` to populate the `dist` directory.
4. Run `npm publish` to publish the package to npm.
